Aim - Demonstration of various git operations on local and remote
repository using git cheat-sheet.

Theory – 
Some git commands are – 
1.	git --version: Displays the installed version of Git.
2.	mkdir<dir name>: Creates a new directory named.
3.	git init : Initialize the new git repository in the current directory.
4.	nano <file name> : Opens the nano text editor to create or edit the file.
5.	git status : Shows the status of the working directory and staging area, including untracked files.
6.	git add –all : Adds all changes in the working directory to the staging area.
7.	git commit -m "some message" : Commits the staged changes with the some message.
8.	git remote add origin <url> : Adds a remote repository named origin with the specified URL.
9.	git push -u origin main : Pushes the committed changes to the main branch of the remote repository and sets the upstream branch.
10.	git log : Displays the commit history.
11.	ls : Lists the files in the current directory.
12.	git rm --cached <file name>: Removes the file from the staging area but keeps it in the working directory.
